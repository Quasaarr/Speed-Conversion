# Speed-Conversion
Program used to convert between Mph, Kmh, Knots, and Mach.
Conversion values from https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/machu.html and https://www.metric-conversions.org/length/feet-to-meters.htm.
Many "while True"s for convience when doing simultanious calculations. 
Speed of Light to be added soon (for fun of course).
